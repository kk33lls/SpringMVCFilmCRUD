# SpringMVCFilmCRUD
## Description
This was our first full stack web application that works as a film site. On the GUI, the user has three options available, they can search a film by the ID number or by keyword, then the user also has an option to add a film. Once the film is displayed, the user is then given the choice to update or delete the film shown. Once any option is selected it will take the user to another interface that displays the options available according to their selection. For example, if user chooses "yes" to delete, the user will redirected to the home page, and that film will now be removed from the query. If the user answers "no", they will be redirected to the home page and no changes will be made. If the user chooses to update the film then they will be directed to a page where they can change the details of the film.
